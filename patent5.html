    Abstract: <br> <br>
The present invention relates to a heating and/or cooling unit (1) for at least one thermal-control fluid (A), said unit (1) comprising at least one loop (3) in which a heat-transfer fluid (F) flows, said loop (3) comprising: <br>
 a phase-change material (5) configured to store energy; <br>
  at least one heat exchanger (7) configured, on the one hand, for said heat-transfer fluid (F) to pass therethrough and, on the other hand, to cool or heat said storage material (5), <br>
   characterised in that said heat exchanger (7) comprises a first structure in which a conduit for the heat-transfer fluid (F) is provided and a second structure surrounding the first structure, a space between said structures defining a housing in which said phase-change material (5) is disposed, the unit (1) being configured to cool or heat said thermal-control fluid (A) by means of the second structure of said exchanger.
<br> <br>
Questions: <br>
<!-- 1. what is the material the shell is constructed out of? <br>
2. what are the materials the phase change material is made of? <br>
3. are there schematics detailing answers to question 1 and 2? <br>
4. refrigerated enclosures limits the container use to cooling? <br>
5. is 'refrigerated enclosure' a legal/commercial term? <br> <br> -->
