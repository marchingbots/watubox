  <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <div class="container">
        <h4 class="mt-1">Indonesia’s National Cooling Action Plan (I-NCAP) represents a comprehensive roadmap to achieving sustainable cooling that reduces energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions, while providing services essential for both human well-being and economic development through the <span class="text-warning">triple strategy of passive cooling, energy efficiency and phase down of climate warming refrigerants.</span></h4>
        <h4 class="mt-3">It sets forth a strategic vision for a cooling sector that is resilient, inclusive and environmentally sustainable. I-NACP provides a holistic view of current and future cooling energy demand across multiple cooling sectors, including <span class="text-warning">space cooling, cold chains and mobile air conditioning.</span> It presents a comprehensive set of interventions to reduce cooling demand, provide thermal comfort and buffer against the impacts of rising temperatures and increasing frequency of extreme heat events. <br>
         </h4>
        <h4 class="mt-3">Its implementation could reduce electricity consumption by 57% and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by 55% in 2040, as compared to business-as-usual.</h4> 
        <h4 class="mt-3">The NCAP is designed to assist the government to <span class="text-warning">identify solutions for energy-efficient and climate-friendly cooling </span>and the
        implementation pathway maximizing socio-economic benefits.</h4> <br>

            Industrial sector includes: <br> 
            livestock, fisheries, processed foods, chemicals, and the pharmaceutical and drug industries <br>
            The demand for cold storage is expected to increase greatly in the coming years,
along with the installed capacity. A survey by the Ministry of Marine Affairs and
Fisheries reported that in 2022, the cold storage capacity for fisheries totalled
763,372 tons (Kementerian Kelautan dan Perikanan 2022). Based on the trends
demonstrated by major cold storage facilities, the need for cold storage can be
expected to increase between 10 per cent and 20 per cent annually on average.

             Space cooling in buildings: This includes refrigerant and non-refrigerant
based space cooling for enhancing thermal comfort in the indoor spaces
of residential and commercial buildings. In this sector, energy consumption
is dominated by refrigerant-based direct expansion (DX) air-conditioning
systems. The energy consumption in space cooling can be reduced through
the integration of efficient urban planning, passive cooling systems,
low-energy not-in-kind systems, efficient service practices and intelligent
controls.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h4>
            Food cold chain: The food cold chain is a chain of logistics activity to service
the market connectivity of perishable products from their production stage
to consumers, including domestic refrigeration. While the cold chain is
commonly understood as covering temperature-controlled warehousing
and transport, it also involves the control of other environmental parameters
(humidity and air composition) and packaging requirements to extend the
product’s life cycle and to safeguard its nutrient quality.
