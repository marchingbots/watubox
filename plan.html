    <h5>
        SHORT<br>
        - focus on manageable issues
        - tactics that can be implemented<br>
        What are the Hard Issues?<br><br>
    </h5>
    <h5>
        WRITTEN<br>
        - encourages precision and focus<br>

    <h5>
        STRATEGIES<br>
        3 Main Elements: <br>
        1. Diagnosis - explains the challenges and opportunities<br>
        2. Guiding Policy - for dealing with challenges / opportunities; <br>
        3. Coherent Actions - to carry out the guiding policy in coordinated steps<br><br>

        1. Diagnosis<br>
        Strategy cannot be developed without diagnosing current situation.<br>
        What is going on? <br>
        - Views: get everyones' view and write them down<br>
        - Clients: they provide info thru surveys and interviews<br>
        - Consultants: provide facilitation and external view<br>
        - Colleagues: advice from other lawyers not competing with you<br>
        - Accountant and bank: can provide context; <br>
        - Independent 3rd parties: can provide particular focus or skill.<br><br>

        2. Strategy<br>
        Devised for dealing with the situation and getting the best outcome for the business. <br>
        - what advantages does the competition have?<br>
        - should differentiate you from others <br>
        <h5 ms-3>Offering same products/services = they become commodities
            <br>Commiditised products = diminished value and price<br>
            solution = BESPOKE (highly personalised) and COMMODITISED services<br>
            Commodity requires streamlined processes, fast turnaround, efficient service, reliance on tech<br><br>
            Differentiation<br>
            Guiding Policy and strategy maps differentiation, specialised differentiated position that increases value of business.
        </h5>
<br><br>
        3. Coherent Actions<br>
        Describes exactly what you are going to do about the situation described in the Strategy. <br> 
        - actions must be coherent: consistent with guiding policy and focused. <br>
        - actions must be applied and taken consistently by everyone in the business<br>
        - compliance by all parties is key<br>
    </h5>
    <br><br>
    <h5>MEASURED<br> 
        coherent actions should be measurable and must be measured.<br>
        - how do you know you achieved your goals?<br>
        - devise indicators for performance of "soft" outcomes (communication, delegation, cross-selling, etc)<br>
        - what are the KPIs?<br>
        - benchmarking - comparing your business against other similar business<br>
    </h5>
    <br><br>
    <h5>
        REGULARLY REVIEWED<br>
        No plan should be set in concrete and should be regularly reviewed.<br>
        - formal annual review<br>
        - one full day, outside the office, no distractions<br>
        - any plan changes written into the planning document<br>
    </h5>
    <br><br>
    <h5>
        OBSERVED BY ALL<Br>
            The plan must be observed by all to get buy-in. <br>
        "WE WILL ALL DO WHAT WE SAY WE WILL DO"<br>
    </h5>

<div class="container">
    <h2>COMPANY CULTURE</h2><br>
    <h5>
        Governance decisions made by partners<br>
        Implementation delegated to management team<br><Br>

    - understanding of this agreed culture makes it easier for partners to delegate power. <br>
    - cultural congruence allows individuals to trust delegates.<br>
    Ethical standards require HIGH PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS = high trust environment.<Br>
